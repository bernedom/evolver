# evolver
Evolver is a simple artificial life simulation. The world consists of organisms which internally are made up of genomes. The simplest organism consist of one genome but the life-forms can become increasingly complex. Whenever an organism multiplies there exists a small chance for mutation which might alter the genome of the newly spawned life form. 

Each organism has a random chance to die each iteration. The older an organism gets the higher the chance. Each organism reaches maturity after a defined period, once an organism is mature it can spawn new organisms.
