# evolver
Evolver is a simple artificial life simulation. The world consists of organisms which internally are made up of genomes. The simplest organism consist of one genome but the life-forms can become increasingly complex. Whenever an organism multiplies there exists a small chance for mutation which might alter the genome of the newly spawned life form. 

Genomes are made up of a list of chars where each char represents a certain characteristic. So each type of organism might react differently to events from the outside. 

## Ideas and todos

* seed random generators to reproduce events
* add text log to UI 
* Colorize different genomes
